## About:

Brain Games - this is my first education project on hexlet.io. 

Brain Games is a set of five console games, built on the principle of popular mobile brain training apps. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Wrong answers end the game and offer to play it again. Games:
* Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be evaluated.
* Progression. Finds missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
* Definition of an even number.
* Determination of the greatest common factor.
* Definition of a prime number.

Game example:
```$ brain-progression
Welcome to the Brain Game!
What number is missing in this progression?
